# KineticModel - ENGG1001 Assignment 1

Legend has it that in 1971, two college students at Yale University used a large slingshot (made with eight 2-metre lengths of surgical rubber) to launch a loaf of frozen bread over their college masterâ€™s house.

You need to write a program that computes the trajectory of the bread. When this program is invoked a user must be able to select one of the following four options:
- i for specifying initial conditions,
- c for computing and plotting the trajectory,
- q for quitting the program, or
- o for determining the optimum launch angle.
